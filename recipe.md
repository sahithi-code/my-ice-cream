first begin with chillingthe bowl and beaters over night in the freezer 
You have to chill the cream and condensed milk in the frige
transfer the condensed milk to the mixing bowl,then add vanila extract and set aside
pour the chilled cream into chilled bowl.
begin to whip with electric beater or stand mixer or hand mixer.whip until soft or stiff peaks depending on our cream.
Add 1 to 2 scoops of condensed milk.you can directly add condensed milk to whipped cream
but i prefer to it this way just as a precaution not to end up deflating the cream.
stir it gently for uniform mixing 
pour that to whipping cream
add sugar
make it to dissolve totally 
shift the mixture into airtight box keep the in frige for 10 hours 
after ten hours our ice cream is ready to eat
